While this is not particularly difficult in JavaScript, in LiveScript it becomes incredibly succinct.<br><br>First we define a curried function which returns true if the first parameter is equally divisible by the second:<br><br><code>dividesInto = (x, y) --> x % y is 0</code><br><br>Then we write our factors function which takes a number and returns an array of its factors:<br><br><code>factors = (n) -> [1 to n] |> filter dividesInto n</code><br><br>And that's it!"
